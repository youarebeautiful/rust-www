# Contributing to Rust

You've started learning Rust. You love it, and you want to be a part
of it. If you're not sure how to get involved, then this page
will help.

**Found a bug and need to report it?** [Follow the bug reporting
guide][bugs]. Thanks in advance!

Rust is an expansive system of projects, the most prominent of which
are maintained by [The Rust Project Developers][devs] in [the
rust-lang organization on GitHub][rust-lang]. Newcomers may be
interested in the project's [CONTRIBUTING.md] file, which explains the
mechanics of contributing to [rust-lang/rust].

There are many ways to contribute to the success of Rust.
This guide focuses on a few avenues for the new contributor:

* [Finding, triaging and fixing issues](contribute-bugs.html). The
  basic work of maintaining a large and active project like Rust.
* [Documentation](contribute-docs.html). Not just official
  documentation, but also for crates, blog posts, and other unofficial
  sources.
* [Community building](contribute-community.html). Helping your fellow
  Rustacean, and expanding the reach of Rust.
* [Tooling, IDEs and infrastructure](contribute-tools.html). The
  important pieces that make using a language practical and painless.
* [Libraries](contribute-libs.html). Rust's suitability for any
  particular task is mostly dependent on availability of quality
  libraries.
* [Language, compiler and the standard
  library](contribute-compiler.html). Language design, feature
  implementation, performance improvement.
* [Internationalization](contribute-translations.html). Help spread the
  Rust love by translating our site to every language.

If you need additional guidance ask on [#rust-internals] or
[internals.rust-lang.org].

We pride ourselves on maintaining civilized discourse, and to that end
contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct][coc]. If you
have questions about this please inquire with the [community team].
