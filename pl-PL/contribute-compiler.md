# Contributing to Rust &mdash; language, compiler, and the standard library


The source code to the compiler and standard library are in the main
repository, and as their maintenance is the primary objective of that
repository, many labels on the issue tracker relate to it. Some of
the more fruitful labels include [A-codegen], for translation of
Rust to LLVM IR; [A-debuginfo], generation of metadata used by debuggers;
[A-diagnostics], the feedback the compiler provides on errors; [A-libs],
issues with the standard library; [A-macros] and [A-syntaxext], both
related to syntax extensions; and [A-typesystem], on the topic of types.

There is no well-maintained guide to the architecture of the compiler,
but [there is a small overview in-tree][rustc-guide]. The [API
documentation for the crates that make up the
compiler][internals-docs] can help with navigating the code, as can
the source code browser [Rust DXR]. The [guide to the Rust test
suite][testsuite] will teach you how to exercise the Rust build system
effectively, as will running [`make tips`][tips] at the command line.

For the foreseable future, one of the major thrusts of Rust compiler
development is converting its internals from operating directly off
the AST to working with an [intermediate representation called
MIR][mir]. This work is expected to open up many new possibilities by
simplifying the compiler and help is needed to e.g. create a MIR-based
translation pass, add MIR-based optimizations, and implement
incremental compilation. There is yet no single source for information
on work needed here, but ask on [internals.rust-lang.org] or
[#rust-internals] for guidance.

[It's embarrasing when our compiler crashes][ice] &mdash; the
dreaded 'internal compiler error' (ICE). The [I-ICE] label
tracks these, and they are often plentiful. These are usually
good bugs to start with because it's easy to know when you've fixed
them, and they're often relatively self-contained.

The performance of Rust code is one of its great advantages; and the
performance of the Rust compiler one of its great weaknesses. Any
improvements to either runtime or &mdash; especially &mdash; compiletime performance
are widely celebrated. The [I-slow] and [A-optimization] labels deal
with runtime performance, and [I-compiletime] with compiletime. We have
a [site that tracks compiletime performance][rustc-perf] on a number
of workloads. The `-Z time-passes` compiler flag can help debug
compiler performance, and Rust code can be profiled with standard
profilers like `perf` on Linux.

Major new features go through a [Request for Comments (RFC)][rfc]
process, by which the design is agreed upon. Though it is open to all,
it is a social process between developers who already have various
amounts of experience working together, and it is recommended to get
involved slowly &mdash; submitting a hasty RFC without understanding
the historical, technical, or social context is an easy way
to make a poor impression and come away disappointed. Read the
aforelinked readme file to understand best how it all works. Many
ideas have been debated in Rust's history, some rejected, some
postponed until the future, and the RFC [issue tracker][rfc-issues]
catalogs some wishlist ideas that have yet to make headway into the
language. Shortly before an RFC is accepted for implementation it
enters 'final comment period', indicated by the [final-comment-period
label on the rust-lang/rfcs repository][rfc-fcp]. Likewise, before a
feature is enabled in the stable compiler (called 'ungating') it
enters [final-comment-period in the rust-lang/rust
repository][issue-fcp]. Both FCPs are critical moments to get involved
and express opinions on the direction of the language, and are
advertised in the weekly subteam reports on [internals.rust-lang.org].

designers in [#rust-lang], and library designers in [#rust-libs].
